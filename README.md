<h2>Why Poolifier? </h2>
Poolifier is used to perform heavy CPU bound tasks on nodejs servers, it implements thread pools ( yes, more thread pool implementations, so you can choose which one fit better for you ) using <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#worker_threads_worker_threads">worker-threads </a>.<br>
With poolifier you can improve your <strong>performance</strong> and resolve problems related to the event loop.<br>
Moreover you can execute your CPU tasks using an API designed to improve the <strong>developer experience</strong>.

<h2> Overview </h2>
Node pool contains two <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#worker_threads_worker_threads">worker-threads </a> pool implementations , you don' t have to deal with worker-threads complexity. <br>
The first implementation is a static thread pool , with a defined number of threads that are started at creation time and will be reused.<br>
The second implementation is a dynamic thread pool with a number of threads started at creation time ( these threads will be always active and reused) and other threads created when the load will increase ( with an upper limit, these threads will be reused when active ), the new created threads will be stopped after a configurable period of inactivity. <br>
You have to implement your worker extending the ThreadWorker class<br>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

```
npm install poolifier --save
```
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

You can implement a worker in a simple way , extending the class ThreadWorker : 

```js
'use strict'
const { ThreadWorker } = require('poolifier')

function yourFunction (data) {
  // this will be executed in the worker thread,
  // the data will be received by using the execute method
  return { ok: 1 }
}

module.exports = new ThreadWorker(yourFunction, { maxInactiveTime: 60000, async: false })
```

Instantiate your pool based on your needed :

```js
'use strict'
const { FixedThreadPool, DynamicThreadPool } = require('poolifier')

// a fixed thread pool
const pool = new FixedThreadPool(15,
  './yourWorker.js',
  { errorHandler: (e) => console.error(e), onlineHandler: () => console.log('worker is online') })

// or a dynamic thread pool
const pool = new DynamicThreadPool(10, 100,
  './yourWorker.js',
  { errorHandler: (e) => console.error(e), onlineHandler: () => console.log('worker is online') })

pool.emitter.on('FullPool', () => console.log('Pool is full'))

// the execute method signature is the same for both implementations,
// so you can easy switch from one to another
pool.execute({}).then(res => {
  console.log(res)
}).catch .... 

```

<strong> See examples folder for more details( in particular if you want to use a pool for [multiple functions](./examples/multiFunctionExample.js) ).</strong>
<strong>Now type script is also supported, find how to use it into the example folder </strong>

<h2 id="nv">Node versions</h2>

You can use node versions 12.x , 13.x, 14.x <br>

<h2 id="api">API</h2>

### `pool = new FixedThreadPool(numThreads, filePath, opts)`
`numThreads` (mandatory) Num of threads for this worker pool <br>
`filePath` (mandatory) Path to a file with a worker implementation <br>
`opts` (optional) An object with these properties :
- `errorHandler` - A function that will listen for error event on each worker thread
- `onlineHandler` - A function that will listen for online event on each worker thread
- `exitHandler` - A function that will listen for exit event on each worker thread
- `maxTasks` - This is just to avoid not useful warnings message, is used to set <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/events.html#events_emitter_setmaxlisteners_n">maxListeners</a> on event emitters ( workers are event emitters)

### `pool = new DynamicThreadPool(min, max, filePath, opts)`
`min` (mandatory) Same as FixedThreadPool numThreads , this number of threads will be always active <br>
`max` (mandatory) Max number of workers that this pool can contain, the new created threads will die after a threshold ( default is 1 minute , you can override it in your worker implementation). <br>
`filePath` (mandatory) Same as FixedThreadPool  <br>
`opts` (optional) Same as FixedThreadPool <br>

### `pool.execute(data)`
Execute method is available on both pool implementations ( return type : Promise): <br>
`data` (mandatory) An object that you want to pass to your worker implementation <br>

### `pool.destroy()`
Destroy method is available on both pool implementations.<br>
This method will call the terminate method on each worker.


### `class YourWorker extends ThreadWorker`
`fn` (mandatory) The function that you want to execute on the worker thread <br>
`opts` (optional) An object with these properties :
- `maxInactiveTime` - Max time to wait tasks to work on ( in ms) , after this period the new worker threads will die.
- `async` - true/false , true if your function contains async pieces else false

<h2 id="cyp">Choose your pool</h2>
Performance is one of the main target of these thread pool implementations, we want to have a strong focus on this.<br>
We already have a bench folder where you can find some comparisons.
To choose your pool consider that with a FixedThreadPool or a DynamicThreadPool ( in this case is important the min parameter passed to the constructor) your application memory footprint will increase . <br>
Increasing the memory footprint, your application will be ready to accept more CPU bound tasks, but during idle time your application will consume more memory. <br>
One good choose from my point of view is to profile your application using Fixed/Dynamic thread pool , and to see your application metrics when you increase/decrease the num of threads. <br>
For example you could keep the memory footprint low choosing a DynamicThreadPool with 5 threads, and allow to create new threads until 50/100 when needed, this is the advantage to use the DynamicThreadPool. <br>
But in general , <strong>always profile your application </strong>
